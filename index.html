                what you told us soon after the (actual) summber break began, this no longer seems to be the case. <br><br>
                It is quite unfortunate that we have to say bye this way, but this is just something I wanted to create to say goodbye in a 
                more meaningful way, and to cement the wonderful memories that not only I had, but all of us had with you in our 
                lives! <br><br>I love you with all my heart chief, we all do. Thank you for being such a great friend time and time again.
                I wish you the best of luck in the upcoming year, and we're all going to miss you very much!

                    <p>As you may know, our secondary school academia has just been one big anime, and it's been 
                        divided into various arcs, like every other anime that you watch. This is just a section that 
                        goes over the various arcs we have faced together, and various memories that we have shared. So, 
                        sit back, strap on tight and enjoy this trip down memory lane!

                    <p>All great anime must start somewhere, and our anime is no exception. Dating back to September of 
                        2017, the first few weeks of Grade 9 at a highschool most of us didn't know and in a program we didn't 
                        know what would entail. I had incredible luck and became a friend of yours quite quickly, as we began to 
                        sit beside eachother in Math Class, and then meeting the rest of the Boiz™ slowly after that. Grade 9 
                        didn't include our most favourite moments, and it wasn't nearly as active as all the other arcs, but we 
                        have all got to start somewhere, no? Keep going to find out what happened next in our legendary anime.

                    <p>God, what can I say about this legendary arc? An art class where we are all sat together and able to talk 
                        all we want along with a teacher that seemed out of it most times? It's almost as if this was bound to 
                        happen. I could go on forever about why this was probably my favourite moment with you and the Boiz™ but 
                        I don't have enough space. Some highlights, God Reggie and God Drake, the meme templates that we made, the 
                        Furamingo song (which I still bump to this day), the list where we ranked all of Naruto's openings (which 
                        cannot be disputed as it is straight facts), and the ever legendary "Two Tails Become One". A furry fanfic 
                        between Vel and I. What were we on when we created that? Nonetheless, we carry on. It's time for the next 
                        arc.

                    <p>We were in some high spirits coming back from the summer school arc and we knew it would be hard 
                        to live up to the hype that was the summer school arc. Nonetheless, we had our ups and downs, but 
                        it never changed our stance as best friends, and we even brought in some new Boiz™ namely Arub and 
                        Jibraan. Our ad for Normal Tape™ will always be superior, Boom Fixed It.

                    <p>Where do I begin with this legendary event? A decision that was made on whim, but I couldn't have asked for 
                        anything better. The slow walk in the blistering cold from the bus stop to your house, the lunch, the smash
                        games, the custom maps, Josiah's Link, Jawad's Meta Knight, your Inkling and my whatever-was-bottom-tier 
                        fighter. It was so fun in fact, we decided to make it an occasion. The iconic t pose video, me twerking, 
                        the ultrasound call where y'all thought my sister was pregnant. Truly crazy and a wonderful occasion, a
                        special that the viewers reacted positively to no cap.

                    <p>Ah yes, the wonderful trip to Ottawa. Sure, the trip to Ottawa wasn't the most fun *cough* On The 
                        Campaign Trail Assignment *cough* but golly was the hotel and all of the activities so fun. The hotel room,
                        the fact that we were beside Ms. Maharaj and Ms. Georgas, the live video we had in which Jibraan was 
                        just brushing his teeth, the image of me punching the pregnant woman and the fact Josiah somehow 
                        managed to sleep in a closet, on top of a safe, an ironing board and god knows what else. Like the last 
                        special, I am confident the viewers enjoyed this special too.

                    <p>
                        This arc wasn't too eventful, but it was still incredibly fun, I guess you could consider it a filler arc?
                        Grade 11 was tough, but we did what we could to get through it. It sucked a bit because all of the Boiz™ 
                        were in separate classes both semesters, and each of us had our own set of responsibilities to attend to, but 
                        it made the lunch times together and the occasional walks together that much more valuable (we could talk
                        all about the wonderful experiences we had with our english teachers). It was cut short unforunately due to the 
                        global pandemic, but the time we were able to spend together was time well spent. The highlight of this semester 
                        was probably going to your house, playing smash, eating pizza and just chilling (unforunately without Josiah), 
                        and losing my Presto card in your couch.

                    <p>This arc is pretty self-explanatory, once the global pandemic hit, everything went virtual, including the 
                        Boiz™. Discord suddenly became our meeting place, and it has remained that way since. All was well, until 
                        the Google Meets Nation decided to attack and hit us with online courses, which was annoying, but didn't stop
                        us from vibing the entire time. It's still going on to this day and even though it's not the same as physically 
                        seeing all of my friends, it is still great that I am able to interact with y'all on a daily basis. Nothing 
                        can stop the Boiz™ from being the Boiz™, not even a raging global pandemic.

                        Don Mills Station/Peanut Plaza/anywhere we decide to go after school is a fitting outro. It's not an arc, but 
                        I just wanted to include this here because it's been so fun being able to walk home with you, some of the 
                        discussions we had still make me laugh to this day. It sucks that you won't be able to partake in these 
                        discussions anymore, but like I mentioned before, it was great walking to Don Mills Station with you and everyone 
                        else. There isn't much I can say, other than the fact that you will be greatly missed on our walks home chief.
